A GoLang application which can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression. 

## Running Non Deterministic Finite Automaton Application

To run the problem sheet you first need to make sure that you have GO on your PC.If you dont go to the link below and download and install GO.

https://golang.org/

To complete the next step GIT is also required on you PC. If you don't have GIT installed go to the link below and download and install GIT

https://git-scm.com/

Once both has been installed you are ready to run the go program Open your Console again and navigate to where you would like to clone the problem sheet repository. To clone enter:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kevind992/Non-Deterministic-Finite-Automaton-Application.git

Once the repository has been cloned, navigate into the problem sheet folder. To build the GO file enter:

    $ go build shuntProblem.go

To run the program, enter:

    $ shuntProblem.exe

The Non Deterministic Finite Automaton Application should now be running on the console.
For both Infix and Pofix, expressions are already predetermined. This can be changed in the option function of the code.
To enter a Pofix notation select '1' , for a infix notation select '2' or to exit select '0'.
A string needs to be entered to see if it matches the expression. Once the string is entered a result of true or false will be displayed.
